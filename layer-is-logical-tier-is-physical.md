> A layer is a logical structuring mechanism for the elements that make up the software solution,
while a tier is a physical structuring mechanism for the system infrastructure.

For example in a web applications generally there are following three layers:

1. Web server, serving static content to front end which is commonly browser.

2. Application server (eg: Rails, Spring etc).

3. A back-end database or data store.
