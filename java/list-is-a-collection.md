A Collection is just that: a collection of items.
You can add stuff, remove stuff, iterate over stuff and query how much stuff
is in there.

A List adds the information about a defined sequence of stuff to it: You can
get the element at position `n`, you can add an element at position `n`, you
can remove the element at position `n`.

In a Collection you can't do that: "the 5th element in this collection" isn't
defined, because there is no defined order.

There are other specialized Collections as well, for example a `Set` which adds
the feature that it will never contain the same element twice.
